correga-power-core=Experimental Power Core found on Correga. Utilizing a form of vacuum energy, it is highly unstable and explosive.\nPower be constantly utilized or stablized to reduce risk.
correga-unstable-power-core=This Power Core has begun to melt down and must be stablized immediately to prevent detonation.\nOr, drop it and run!
correga-stablization-cage=A complex mechanism to regulate the power output of Experimental Power Cores.
correga-stablized-core=A fully stablized Experimental Power Core. It will no longer destablize on its own and energy can be extracted until it becomes depleted.\nHowever, the cage limits its ability to perform certain experimental processes, and the assembled unit is too sensitive to survive a rocket launch.
correga-depleted-stablized-core=A formerly-stablized Experimental Power Core has exceeded the stablization parameters and gone critical. The core must be extracted and stablized immediately.
correga-result-power-core=A process has affected the stability of this Experimental Power Core. It will restablize on its own in a moment... most likely.

[technology-description]
planet-discovery-correga=A rogue planet with a highly eccentric orbit, currently far from the sun with little light. Ancient ruins with strange energy readings dot the landscape.\nLarge portions of the planet appear fractured by massive surface explosions. Something bad happened here.
correga-emergency-stablization=You've discovered some sort of unstable power core. Quickly, see if you can stablize it before it detonates!
correga-core-stablization=You have successfully stablized the core and averted disaster. You'd better try and keep these things stable in the future. Perhaps these could be used for power production...
correga-experimental-synthesis=With access to vast amounts of energy, you may now be able to crack the final frontier: Synthesis of matter itself.

[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
correga-briefing=[planet=Correga] is another planet dotted with ruins that appear to be from the same civilization that inhabited Fulgora. A wildly eccentric orbital path suggests it likely was affected by some apocalyptic event in the past. Strange energy readings come from underground vaults and may merit further exploration.\nIt appears this may have been a research outpost. Fractured landmasses and a the irregular orbit indicate it may have been the site of a massively powerful explosion. Whatever secrets you discover here, be careful.
